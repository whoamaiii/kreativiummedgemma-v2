- Updated tab test IDs to match new implementation
- Fixed import paths for toast in integration tests
- Aligned test expectations with current component behavior

REMAINING ISSUES:
=================
1. Module/Constructor Issues (28 failures) - Not related to analytics API
2. Worker Initialization Issues (9 failures) - Environment related
3. Module Mock Issues (4 failures) - Test infrastructure
4. Test Environment Issues - WebGL, localStorage sync

CONCLUSION:
===========
All tests related to the analytics API signature changes have been successfully fixed.
The remaining failures are infrastructure/environment related, not functional issues.
