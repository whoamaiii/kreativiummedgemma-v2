# Kreativium Beta v2

Modern Vite + React + TypeScript app with an accessible, analytics-driven UI and strong testing, i18n, and performance practices.

---

## Quickstart

1) Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2) Start the dev server (Vite on port 5173)

```bash
npm run dev
```

3) Build and preview locally

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite 7 + SWC
- Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui patterns
- Testing: Vitest + Testing Library + Playwright
- i18n: i18next + resource bundles in `src/locales`

## Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start Vite dev server
- `npm run build`: Production build to `dist/`
- `npm run preview`: Serve the built app locally
- `npm run lint` / `npm run typecheck`: ESLint 9 + TS type checks
- `npm run test`: Unit/integration tests (Vitest)
- `npm run e2e`: Playwright end-to-end tests
- `npm run docs:check`: Prettier + markdownlint on docs
- `npm run seed:demo`: Seed demo content

## Quality & CI Hints

- Keep functions small and focused; follow single-responsibility
- Prefer composition, hooks, and dependency injection for testability
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run typecheck` before commits/PRs
- For analytics changes, run tests with coverage and update thresholds if needed
